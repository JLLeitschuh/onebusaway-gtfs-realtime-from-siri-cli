onebusaway-gtfs-realtime-from-siri

  The {{{http://code.google.com/transit/realtime/}GTFS-realtime}} specification defines a standard for exchanging
real-time public transit information in a machine-readable way.  The core of the specification is Protocol Buffer
definition defining the various data types that make up a GTFS-realtime feed.

  While Protocol Buffers are designed to be language agnostic, language-specific bindings are typically generated to
read or write a buffer using a specific language.  We provide a simple Java library of the classes produced when the
{{{http://code.google.com/transit/realtime/}GTFS-realtime}} protobuf is compiled for Java.

  You can use the library in a number of ways:
